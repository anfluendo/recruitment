# Multimedia Engineer Test

## What is this test about?
If you are reading this document, then you are in the process of becoming a new member of our team. Like any other company, at Fluendo we are looking for the best talent to join our team, but it’s always hard to do so just by reading a CV or in a 1-hour Q&A interview.

The goal of this test is to quickly understand how you would fit in our team by hacking on a very simple video player application using the same development stack and tools we use on a daily basis. The video player app uses the GStreamer framework for video playback and either Qt or Gtk for the UI, using the one you know the most. As you will see, the test itself is quite simple and depending on your skills you should finish it in around 2-4 hours. It will try to cover some important aspects to us:
 * Use of git
 * Working with an existing code base
 * Parallelism and threads
 * Clean code
 * Documentation
 * Understanding of User Stories
 * Whatever other thing you want to show us!

## The rules

We will provide you with a description of a new feature for the video player app, as it would be done by our Product Manager, and a list of User Stories describing its functionality.
You will create the new application and publish your work in a private repository using a service like github, gitlab or bitbucket.
As you will see, the User Stories do not have any UI design, so design it as you want since it won’t be taken in account.
What we will value instead, is the ability to work with new API’s, your autonomy to interpret and implement User Stories, the use of good design patterns and your ability to split your work into commits and branches.

## Video Player new features

At Fluendo we have decided to improve this video player with a set of new features, which are provided as new user storiess from our PM's

### Report the duration of the clip to the user
As a user, I would like to know the duration of the video clip loaded.
The duration should be printed in the controls bar with the following format:

`Duration: HH:mm:ss.SSS`

The story is successful when the user loads [Tears Of Steel]( http://ftp.halifax.rwth-aachen.de/blender/demo/movies/ToS/tears_of_steel_720p.mov) and the player shows:
`Duration 00:12:14.167`

### Know the current position of the stream
As a user, I would like to know the current position of the stream in the video player.
The current position should be updated with an interval of 20 ms.
The current position will be displayed in the controls bar before the total duration with the same format. The expected output is:

`Position: HH:mm:ss.SSS  Duration: HH:mm:ss.SSS`

The story is sucessful when the user starts playing a clip and the current position is updated.

### Seek to a position in the stream.
As a user, I would to seek to a position in the stream in the video player using a slider.
Considering the slider has a range between 0 and 1, the value of the slider is the relative position of the stream, calculated like `current_position/duration`.
The position of the slider will be updated with the same interval as the position label.
When the user drags the slider it will change the position of the stream with a seek.
The final design including the slider should like like:

`Position: HH:mm:ss.SSS [-----------------|---------------] Duration: HH:mm:ss.SSS`

The story is successful when the user starts playing a clip and the slider is updated with the relative position.
The story is successful when the drags the slider and a seek is performed updating the position of the stream.

### Create a timeline with a snapshots preview
As a user I would like to visually preview the contents of the stream once its loaded, in the form of 10 thumbnails displayed in a timeline. Thumbnails are spaciated in time at 1/10th of the duration of the clip. The thumbnails generation should happen in background and the timeline should be updated asynchonously with the new thumbnails as they are generated.
Here is an example of the desired feature.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fluendo/recruitment/master/content/timelinepreview2.png" alt="enable-repl" width="300">

In the snapshot project you will find a sample code to extract thumbnails from a video file.

The story is successful when the user loads a new video file and the thumbnails timeline is progressively generated with 10 thumbnails.

It's time to start hacking!

## Video Player project

The Video Player project has 3 components:
  * videoplayer-qt: sample video player using the Qt framework
  * videoplayer-gtk3: sample video player using the Gtk+3 framework
  * snapshot: sample application to get snapshots from a video file

The sources of the video player are taken from the GStreamer project examples and tutorials with the intention to provide a very basic starting point to start implementing new features for the test.

### Setup

On a Debian 10 ("Buster") machine, or a machine with a Debian-like OS, install the following packages for a working development and runtime environment.  Note that the following packages are necessary regardless of whether you intend to develop for Qt or GTK+:
```
apt-get install cmake libgstreamer1.0-dev libgstreamer-plugins-base1.0-dev libboost-dev libgles2-mesa-dev gstreamer1.0-libav
```

### Building for GTK+ 3 (recommended if you are familiar with GTK+ 3)

If you are developing for videoplayer-gtk3 then additionally install the following packages:
```
apt-get install libgdk-pixbuf2.0-dev libgtk-3-dev
```

### Building for Qt4 (easy at first, but not recommended for runtime stability)

If you are doing the test using Qt4 (videoplayer-qt) then you should use Ubuntu 16.04 and install appropriate dependencies.
```
apt-get install libqt4-dev qtgstreamer-plugins libqtgstreamer-dev qtgstreamer-declarative
```

**WARNING**: Previously specified dependencies and OS were causing build errors due to the following reasons for videoplayer-qt when built against Qt4:
1.  A (now-fixed) typo and incompatible build-time dependencies across "Debian-like systems".
2.  The videoplayer-qt application breaks after **mandatory** system-wide upgrades imposed on the user by Ubuntu 16.04.

### Building for Qt5 (recommended if you are familiar with Qt5)

For Qt5 there are some things to fix in the setup and the build system and if you are confident enough about your Qt and CMake skills you can try to go for this option.

### Configure
The project uses a CMake build system. Configure it for
```
cmake CMakeLists.txt
```

### Build
Once configured type:
```
make
```

### Run
To run the app launch:
```
./videoplayer
```

The player starts without any video file open. Click the open button and select a video file.
